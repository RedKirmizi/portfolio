Some of my favorite projects include building Karner, a mock game credits shop I built to simulate the experience of purchasing in-game currency. It allows users to browse, select, and 'purchase' credits, mimicking a real-world transaction system for games. I designed it to showcase my front-end development skills, user interface design, and an understanding of e-commerce flows.

Outside of coding, I enjoy traveling to different places, which keeps me creative and motivated.
